https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon
The Panopticon is a type of institutional building designed by the
English philosopher and social theorist Jeremy Bentham in the late 18th century.
The concept of the design is to allow a single watchman to observe (-opticon)
all (pan-) inmates of an institution without the inmates being able to tell
whether or not they are being watched. Although it is physically impossible
for the single watchman to observe all cells at once, the fact that the
inmates cannot know when they are being watched means that all inmates
must act as though they are watched at all times, effectively controlling
their own behaviour constantly. The name is also a reference to Panoptes
from Greek mythology; he was a giant with a hundred eyes and thus was known
to be a very effective watchman.
